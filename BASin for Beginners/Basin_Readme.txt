BASin For Beginners 1.0

Welcome to BASin, and many thanks on behalf of the creators of the "Every Child Can Code" initiative for using this package.

What is BASin?

BASin is what many programmers call a "development tool" - it is a program that makes it easy to make other programs. Back when the ZX Spectrum was the king of home computers, people would use BASIC to program it, and it had some very odd quirks when it came to doing this. Each key produced an entire codeword, and when pressed with other keys produced yet more! It was very confusing to a beginner. 

BASin aims to help you by removing that - we have proper keyboards on all of our computers today, so why not use them? BASin also gives you a much larger amount of screen area to show your program code, which you will find much more comfortable than the small screen that the Spectrum used. 

You can also use BASin's extra tools to "debug" (find mistakes) in your program - that means that you can watch your program run line by line, you can watch things change slowly step by step, or you can stop the program and examine the things that make it work in your own time. And always remember that help is there for you if you need it - every screen and every window in BASin has a help menu for you to use.

Finally, it is important to understand that although BASin gives you a lot of nice features, it is still a ZX Spectrum inside - and any program you write will run on a real ZX Spectrum or the new ZX Vega exactly as it does in BASin. 

BASin makes it fun to learn to write programs, and will help you get started in the wonderful world of computer programming.

Many thanks for using BASin For Beginners.
