BASINÇ Version 1.7 (20.11.2017) by Arda "ref" Erdikmen

This is not BASin. BasinC is a fork of highly successful Basin Project by Paul Dunn et al. 
BasinC is based on Basin's R14 source code and working parts of R15 source.

USAGE/INSTALLATION:
No installer. Unzip all files whereever you want, and execute Basinc.exe. Exe file should have read/write permission to it's folder to save settings.

UPGRADING FROM AND OLDER INSTALLATION
If you are upgrading from pre-1.7 version it's recommended to start fresh. New basinc requires autoback folder and basinC.bin file to run properly.

(C) 2001-2008 by Paul Dunn. Based in part on the code for ZXSpin - with help from members of the SPIN team. The Assembler engine included within is the work of Mark Boyd (a SPIN team member), and so I would like to acknowledge his work in this regard. The z80 core was created with the help of Mark Woodmass, whose SpecEmu emulator is one of the smallest and fastest of the Windows emulators.
The ROM Files (48.rom and 128.rom) are provided with the kind permission of Amstrad Ltd.
The Sinclair Spectrum BASIC programming manual is reproduced and modified for relevance to BASin with the permission of Amstrad Ltd, edited and compiled into HTML help format by Paul E Collins.
Many thanks to Amstrad, who retain all copyrights on any of their material used or modified in this package.
