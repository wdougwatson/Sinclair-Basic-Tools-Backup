BASin release 14d

Welcome to BASin, and many thanks for trying this package.


BASin is an advanced Sinclair Spectrum development environment based around the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k and 128k models. It provides a user-friendly and powerful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which makes programming in this exciting and frivolous language an absolute joy. It is not just a simple interpreter - BASin utilises a very fast and accurate emulation engine which guarantees a high degree of accuracy and compatibility with other Emulators and their file types[1].

Included are many example programs and a full on-line manual accessible from BASin itself via the Help menu in the main editor. Thanks to the unbelievable generosity of Amstrad, the full Sinclair BASIC manual (Orange Book) is also available which contains a complete course in programming the BASIC implementation found on Sinclair Spectrum computers.

For completeness, I have decided that BASin should be distributed with full source code. This Source is provided for reference only, if you use this source code in your own projects, then please credit me (Paul Dunn). Other than that, use it for what you will. It Compiles using Delphi 5 Enterprise and FastLib package By Gordon Alex Cowie III, Theme Manager by Mike Lischke (www.lischke-online.de) and the TMPHexEditor component by markus stephany (merkes@mirkes.de, found at torry.net)

Note - the Fastlib package has recently been altered, and no longer includes TFastIMG. Mail me at paul.dunn4@ntlworld.com if you need this component. I will provide it as long as the author does not object.

FastLib can be obtained from: http://www.xepol.com/fastlib/ - which appears to be the new home, as the original author can't maintain it any longer.

Warning - Although the supplied 48.rom and 128.rom files are not modified by BASin (this is done in-memory, not to the files themselves), BASin relies on the fact that the ROMs are unmodified for the majority of it's runtime operation. The use of non-standard ROMs will likely break BASin. If there are any features that you feel another ROM supplies that BASin would benefit from, then please get in touch and I'll be more than happy to take them under consideration.

BASin will not format your hard-drive, no matter what certain individuals may tell you.

See the supplied What's_New.txt for information on bugs fixed and features added to this release.

Thankyou for using BASin.

The Assembler engine included within is the work of Mark Boyd (a SPIN team member), and so I would like to acknowledge his work in this regard. The z80 core was created with the help of Mark Woodmass, whose SpecEmu emulator is one of the smallest and fastest of the Windows emulators.

Many thanks to Amstrad, who retain all copyrights on any of their material used or modified in this package.
